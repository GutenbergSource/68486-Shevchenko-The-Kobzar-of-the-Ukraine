 </p><p><hi>The decorations and illustrations in this book are meant to show something of Ukrainian art.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The artistic instincts of the peasant women find satisfaction largely in the working of embroidery, each district having its own characteristic types of design.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>One of Shevchenko&#8217;s favorite fancies was to compare his versification to the work of the girls and women embroidering their designs on their garments. He frequently speaks of himself as &#8220;embroidering verses.&#8221;</hi>

 </p><p><hi>It is a favorite device of Ukrainian book-makers to decorate their pages with miniature landscapes and little figures.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The frontispiece of the present work is a picture of Shevchenko in youth from an original painted by himself. On page 129 we see him as he looked after his return from exile.</hi>

 <pb id="pb9" n="9" facs="f:009"/> </p></div1><div1 id="introduction" type="Introduction"><head rend="image(images/o009.jpg)">INTRODUCTION.</head><p><hi>Nearly twenty years ago the translator of these poems was sent by the Presbyterian church as a medical missionary to a newly settled district in Manitoba. A very large proportion of the incoming settlers in this district were Ukrainians, indeed it was largely owing to the interest taken in these newcomers that the writer was sent there.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>It was Mr. John Bodrug who first, introduced him to the study of the poems of Shevchenko and with his help translations of three or four of the poems were made a dozen years ago. Press of other work prevented the following up of this study till last summer when with the help of Mr. Sigmund Bychinsky translations were made of the other poems here given, and considerable time spent in arriving at an understanding of the spirit of the poems and the nature of the situations described. Then the more formidable task was approached of trying to carry over not only the thought but something  <pb id="pb10" n="10" facs="f:010"/>of the style, spirit and music of the original into the English tongue.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The spirit of Shevchenko was too independent to suffer him to be much bound by narrow rules of metre and rhyme. The translator has found the same attitude convenient, for when the versification may be varied as desired it is much easier to preserve the original thoughts intact.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The writer&#8217;s thanks are due for help and advice to Messrs. Arsenych, Woicenko, Rudachek, Ferley, Sluzar and Stechyshyn and especially to Mrs. Bychinsky and for help with the manuscript to Miss Sara Livingstone.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>How many English-speaking people have heard of Taras Shevchenko?</hi>

 </p><p><hi>What &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin&#8221; did for the negroes of the United States of America the poems of Shevchenko did for the serfs of Russia. They aroused the conscience of the Russian people, and the persecutions suffered by the poet at the hands of the autocracy awakened their sympathy.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>It was two days after the death of Shevchenko that the czar&#8217;s ukase appeared granting freedom to the serfs. Possibly the dying poet knew it was coming and died the happier on that account.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>But in still another way does this man&#8217;s figure stand out. In the country called the Ukraine is a nation of between thirty and forty millions of people, having a language of their own&#8212;the language in which these poems were composed.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>This has been, as it were, a nation lost, buried alive one might say, beneath the power of surrounding empires.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>They have a terrible history of oppression, alternating with desperate revolts <pb id="pb12" n="12" facs="f:012"/>against Polish and Muscovite tyranny.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>In these poems speaks the struggling soul of a downtrodden people. To our western folk, reared in happier surroundings there is a bitter tang about some of them, somewhat like the taste of olives, to which one must grow accustomed. The Slavonic temperament, too, is given to melancholy and seems to dwell congenially in an atmosphere misty with tears. But he gravely misreads their literature who fails to perceive the grim resolve beneath the sorrow.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>In the struggle of the Ukrainians for freedom the spirit of this poet, who was born a serf, remains ever their guiding star.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>It happened sometimes, when a cossack warrior found his energies failing and his joints growing stiff from much campaigning, he would bethink him of his sins and deeds of blood.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>These things weighing on his mind, he would decide to spend the remainder of his life in a monastery, but before taking this irrevocable step, he would hold a time of high revel with his old comrades. This poem pictures such an event.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Back somewhere in the middle distance of European history&#8212;when the Ukraine was under Polish rule, though ever harrassed by the devastating raids of Turks and Tartars&#8212;there developed bands of guerilla fighters in the wild border-land beyond the rapids of the Dnieper.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Sometimes fighting against the Tartars, sometimes in alliance with them, they became known by the name &#8216;Kazak,&#8217; a word of uncertain origin.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Fierce banditti they were, many of them serfs who had run away from their Polish masters. But they often developed great military power. At times the Poles succeeded in securing numbers of them as fighters in their army, but when the tyranny of the Polish landlords became intolerable the so-called &#8220;Registered Cossacks&#8221; would sometimes join with the &#8220;Free Cossacks&#8221; of the &#8220;border land&#8221;&#8212;which is the meaning of the word &#8220;Ukraine,&#8221; and exact terrible vengeance on the Poles.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The story of these warlike deeds of the Cossacks has the same significance to the Ukrainian people that the tales of Wallace and Bruce have for Scotchmen.</hi>

The poet represents one of the excursions of the Zaparoggian Cossacks under the <corr sic="leader-">leadership</corr> of Hamaleia on Skutari, the Turkish city on the <corr sic="Bosphorns">Bosphorus</corr>. The Cossacks saved western Europe from the Tartar and Turkish invasions, by fighting the invaders in the land of the barbarian. The poem describes one of these excursions where the Cossacks animated by the desire of revenging themselves on the Turks and freeing their brothers who were lying as captives in Turkish prisons, undertake a perilous trip in small wooden boats over the stormy Black Sea to Skutari, open the prisons, burn the city, and return home with rich spoils and their freed brethren.</hi>

 <pb id="pb36" n="36" facs="f:036"/> </p></div1><div1 id="forming" type="Chapter"><head rend="image(images/o103.png)">The Forming of a Life</head><p><hi>The little Taras was born a serf. His first memories are of a mother&#8217;s love, of the kindness of an elder sister, and like a musical undertone to all his life&#8212;the consciousness of the wonderful beauty of Nature.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>But soon another power of hideous aspect laid its grasp on the childish soul. It was the knowledge of slavery, a grim and horrible thing that was slowly but surely grinding out the lives of his parents, and that would surely, later, reach out for his own.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Yet even the system of serfdom may allow a little happiness to a child, still too young to work.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The little boy had been told that beyond the distant hills were iron pillars holding up the sky. At five years of age he set out to find these pillars. Some teamsters found him wandering on the steppe and brought him back to his home. But this incident marked the character of the boy as an idealist and a dreamer.</hi>

 <pb id="pb37" n="37" facs="f:037"/></p><p><hi>Then there was Grandfather John, the brave old man who, half a century before, had fought in the ranks of the Haidemaki who so nearly broke the Polish power. On a Sunday the wondering family would listen to the mighty voice ringing out in the little home&#8212;telling of ancient battles for freedom.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>When Taras was seven years of age he lost his mother. His father was left with six children, and thought to improve matters by marrying a widow with three. Thereafter the miseries increased for little Taras who was hated by his stepmother.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The father lived a few years longer, and to him Taras owed the knowledge of reading, for though they were serfs and lived in a wretched hovel, the Shevchenko&#8217;s prided themselves on having retained some elements of culture.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Our little hero, however, had a strange passion for drawing and painting and also for singing, and found some employment among the drunken painters, and church-singers of the village.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Later his master tried to make him work, but found the lad hopeless for anything but his beloved painting. Finally, he reached Petrograd in the suite of his master&#8217;s son, where he was apprenticed to a decorator.</hi>

 <pb id="pb38" n="38" facs="f:038"/></p><p><hi>A famous man came upon a ragged boy sitting on a pail, in the Royal Gardens, in the moonlight, drawing a picture of a statue there. This was the beginning of a period of good fortune. The lad was introduced to some of the great men of the capital. His genius was recognized. A famous painter painted a picture that was raffled off for sufficient money to purchase the boy&#8217;s freedom, and he was entered as a student in the Academy.</hi>

What was left of the week, they were granted to earn subsistence for themselves and their families.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>But that was not the worst. More bitter than labor was the fact that they were not their own, were chattels of their lord, who could sell them at his pleasure or gamble them away at cards.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>He could beat them too, or kill them if he wished, without fear, for what advocate would take up the case of a penniless serf against the all-powerful aristocracy.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Hideous, too, was the glaring fact that young daughters of the serfs were regarded as the legitimate prey of the landlord and, his sons.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>In these later days the sins of the fathers have been visited in awful fashion on the descendants of these landlords. But can we <pb id="pb80" n="80" facs="f:080"/>wonder that in the writings of a poet whose childhood was poisoned by knowledge of such injustice, we find evidence of the growing avenging fury that later was to bring about such awe-inspiring convulsions in human society.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Through all of Shevchenko&#8217;s verse there sounds the great theme of that contrast between the beauty of God&#8217;s world, and the horrors of human cruelty.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>This is the national poem of the Ukrainians, recited at all their gatherings. I have given the thought and something of the feeling. The music of the original I could not give. It begins like a Highland dirge with wailing amphibrachs, and there are other measures in it not used in our language. Perhaps some future student may be moved to put this poem in such English form as will give the true impression of the original.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The motive of the poem is, in part, to awaken the conscience of the young educated Ukrainians who, for the sake of gain were allowing themselves to be used as tools by foreign oppressors.</hi>

Shortly after he travelled to the Ukraine, purposing to devote his life to the service of his own people.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>His progress was a triumphal march, a succession of banquets and popular welcomes and entertainments at the homes of the wealthy.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>At Kiev people still remember that the earliest Russian civilization had its beginnings in the Ukraine. There Christianity first took root, and there were the first Russian Princes.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Before Shevchenko&#8217;s arrival there was organized at Kiev the Society of Cyril and Methodius, called after the great apostles of Russia, and the leading spirits of the Society were professors in the University of Kiev.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Into this brilliant company Shevchenko was welcomed. Its leaders became his devoted friends. A chair of painting in the University was to be established for him.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Most remarkable were the relations between Shevchenko and Professor Kulisch. <pb id="pb104" n="104" facs="f:104"/>Kulisch was to be married to a great lady, a daughter of one of the nobles of the country. The poet was invited to the wedding and the bride, in her enthusiasm, actually kissed his hand. This was an astonishing act of condescension towards one who had been a serf, but this lady, herself afterwards a famous authoress, cherished the memory to her dying day.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Shevchenko&#8217;s saddest experience in the Ukraine was when he visited his native village and found his brothers and sisters in serfdom. His dream was to earn enough money to purchase their freedom, and afterwards to devote his life to the liberation of the peasantry. The poem&#8212;&#8220;The Bondwoman&#8217;s Dream&#8221;&#8212;commemorates the poet&#8217;s meeting with his favorite sister, Katherine, working as a slave.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>His friends thought he should go to Italy to perfect himself in painting. Madame Kulisch purposed to sell her family jewels to raise sufficient money to send Shevchenko to that country. Her husband who was in the plot told Shevchenko that some wealthy person had contributed the money but he must not ask for the donor&#8217;s name.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>But on returning to Kiev from the Kulisch home a policeman put his hand on the shoulder of the poet painter.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The bright dream was ended.</hi>

He hated liberal thought and detested the idea of educating the masses.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>Tens of thousands of copies of the New Testament and the Psalter were burned by his orders. He said such books were for the priests, not for the common people. Incidentally it may be remarked that the priests had to teach what he wanted or lose their jobs.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>To speak against his government, or even to criticize czars who reigned hundreds of years before him was a crime.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The little band of dreamers who formed the Society of Cyril and Methodius actually hoped to convert this autocrat, and secure his assistance in freeing the people. They had visions of a free Confederation of Slavonic states, after the pattern of the United States of America, but with the czar as head. But they sadly misjudged their man.</hi>

 <pb id="pb113" n="113" facs="f:113"/></p><p><hi><corr sic="Shechenko">Shevchenko</corr> had actually spoken impertinently of the Autocrat in his poems. He refused to retract.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The government really wished to he lenient, if he would only be good and confess that he had done wrong. But Shevchenko was not of those who are willing to admit that black is white.</hi>

 </p><p><hi>The gloomy autocracy now pronounces his doom&#8212;a sort of living death in Siberian barracks. The czar added to the sentence, with his own hand, the proviso that he should not be allowed either to write or to paint.</hi>

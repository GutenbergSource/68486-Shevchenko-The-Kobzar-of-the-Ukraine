<p>Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko (in Ukrainian: –¢–∞—Ä–∞—Å –ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ) is a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, public and political figure, as well as folklorist and ethnographer. His literary heritage is regarded to be the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature and, to a large extent, the modern Ukrainian language, though the language of his poems was different from the modern Ukrainian language. Shevchenko is also known for many masterpieces as a painter and an illustrator. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko</a>). His status is confirmed by his presence on the Ukrainian 100 hryvnia banknote.</p>
<p>This short collection of renderings in English can serve to give an impression of his work, but also of the long suffering of Ukraine.</p></BODY></HTML>
